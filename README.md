# AutomationFrmwrks
Automation (polyglot)Framework Projects

Project objectives -> create an automation framework (from scratch) for the following languages

* C#

* Go

* Node

* Python

* Java

* JS -> React, TestCafe

## Major pitfalls to avoid

	1. If copying/pasting code or idea learned from previous project (add reference from credible source and/or credit)

	2. Do not write a C# framework in the style of Java, follow the C# .NEt idiom (do not repurpose Java into C#)

	3. Create UML, decision trees, high level diagrams

	4. Prepare an example of BDD vs TDD, reference reputable *source/literature

	5. If you're using a .PDF, purchase the hardcopy to support the author(s) (MLA reference)

	6. Cover none functional tests, e.g performance testing with artilary.io, Bees With Machine Guns

	7. Dockerize your tests

	8. Understand Feature release and how to Integration tests with unit tests and develop a pipeline within each language ecosystem (using AWS,azure pipelines etc)

	9. Have fun, like checkout github copilot
